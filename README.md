## Target Audience 

Teenagers -> Adults around their 30’s 

Fans of the same types of games from other indie developers 

## Target Platform 

Windows PC 

## Story (world, characters, locations…) 

Chickenboy escapes from the farm to a magical forest 

Set in a world like ours but with magic and monsters 

## Gameplay (objectives, game progression…) 

The chicken is escaping the farm to the magical forest from monsters like slimes and flying eyes 

Puzzles must be completed to continue through the game like finding the key to escape the farm and collecting items in the magical forest 

## Game Mechanics (controls, rules, physics, combat…) 

Running, jumping, melee attack, healing pickups, adding an egg that becomes a platform the player could use to jump, slimes as ground enemies and flying eyes as flying enemies and collecting items 

## Graphics and styling (2D, 3D, pixel-art, low-poly…) 

2D pixel-art sprites with animations, and tile maps 

## Needed assets (music, effects, 3D models…) 

Sprites for main character and enemies, sound effects for actions, soundtracks for BGMs, possibly tile map assets and backgrounds 

## Monetization 

Sold on platformers like Steam, Epic Games Store and GOG 

Maybe provide a possibility for people to back up the game by becoming an early backer or early access on Steam
